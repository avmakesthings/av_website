            Hi. <br>
            <br>My name is Anastasia Victor and I’m an XR designer and artist based in San Francisco<br>

            <br>I use standard UI design tools [Sketch / AdobeCC] along with 3D modeling/animation tools [Blender/ Rhino] and Unity [C#] to design and build 3D interfaces. I've also worked with webVR / A-Frame and am comfortable with web front-end [JS/HTML/CSS].<br>

            <br>My background is in UI/UX design for web and mobile but prior to that I worked as an architect, designing physical spaces. It's great to be able to combine my knowledge and experience from both these worlds to create usable and compelling immersive experiences. <br>
                    
            <br>I’m currently a resident at the <a href = "https://grayarea.org"/>Gray Area </a> Art and Technology Incubator.<br> 
            
            <br>Please get in touch if you'd like to work with me or chat about XR :<br>
