            Oh hiiiii .... Thanks for dropping by.  Read on for a little more info about me and what I do. <br>
            <br>Though my background is in environmental design &amp; (I have a Masters of Architecture degree from UC Berkeley) I currently design experiences for VR &amp; am working on a few independent VR projects.        
            <br>Despite having worked as a designer &amp; project manager for 5 years, half of which was spent on consumer web and mobile products, I'm still pretty new to the VR game and am currently in a VR bootcamp, learning Unity etc. <br>
            <br>VR/AR is really exciting to me as a medium that bridges my skills in UI/UX with my skills as an environmental designer  <br>
            <br>When not in the metaverse, Iâ€™m typically playing with modular synthesizers, indulging my vinyl obsession, experimenting with GF cooking or snowboarding (if the season permits).<br> 
            <br>You can find me on <a href = "https://www.linkedin.com/in/anastasiavictor">Linkedin</a>, <a href = "https://twitter.com/AVmakesthings">Twitter</a>, <a href = "https://soundcloud.com/aaaavvvv">Soundcloud</a> or <a href = "https://www.instagram.com/avmakesthings/?hl=en">Instagram</a><br> or email me at <a href = "mailto:hello@anastasia.io">  hello [at] anastasia.io</a>
