            Hi. <br>
            <br>My name is Anastasia Victor and Iâ€™m an XR designer and artist based in San Francisco.<br>

            <br>My background is in UI/UX design for web and mobile but prior to that I worked as an architect, designing physical spaces. I am currently exploring ways to bridge these areas through XR and have worked with clients like Google and Burning Man.<br>
            
            <br>I am also interested in the social impacts of emerging tech and the ways in which immersive art can be used to promote public discourse around these technologies. In 2018, I co-founded <a href = "http://placexr.org"/>Place</a>, a design think tank exploring the social and spatial implications of augmented reality. <br>
                    
            <br>Currently, I'm a resident at the <a href = "https://grayarea.org"/>Gray Area </a> Art and Technology Incubator and at Mozilla XR Studio. I was also part of Oculus Launchpad in 2018 :) <br> 
            
            <br>Please get in touch if you'd like to work with me or chat about XR :<br>
