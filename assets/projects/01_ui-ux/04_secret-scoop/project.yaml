      description: >
       We began the redesign process by researching how the site was currently being used and developing personas based on user surveys and qualitative user testing of the old site. Preliminary user testing helped us decide to focus on a responsive website, instead of additionally designing a mobile app.

       The Secret Scoop Website is still a work in progress. The site, perhaps due to it's simplicity has been performing well and is slated for a rebuild in early 2017 which will be timed with the opening of Secret Scoop's first public retail outlet in Berkeley.
