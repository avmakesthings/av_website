description: Designing experiences for virtual reality is the most exciting thing I do! I love being able to combine the spatial thinking of my architectural design background with web/mobile interaction and audio to create cool shit. Iâ€™m currently working on designing and building a VR game called Sonar and an interacactive music experience called Scapes.
