description: Designing experiences for virtual reality is the most exciting thing I do. I love being able to combine the spatial thinking of my architectural design background with web/mobile interaction and audio to create novel immersive experiences. Iâ€™m currently using game design as a way to learn Unity & explore the nuances of game interaction.  I'm also in a VR bootcamp at the Noisebridge hackerspace, working on getting better at things like writing custom shaders.  Baby steps ;)
