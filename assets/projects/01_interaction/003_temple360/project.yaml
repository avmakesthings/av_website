      description:  A forest in the desert is an open source VR prototype that aims to contextually relate the content generated over the design and construction of the 2017 Burning Man Temple. It was designed and built using A-Frame.

      description: In an age of ubiquitous computing and portable electronics, capturing and sharing our experiences has never been easier.  Many platforms exist to facilitate this (e.g. Instagram, Facebook, Flickr), yet presenting this content in a meanful way is still challenging.

      description:  This was a problem I encountered when trying to present a years worth of content generated over the course of an intallation art project I worked on in 2017. I looked at different categorization techniques for web and mobile content and found that relating content through contexual information eg.geotagging in Apple photos was a good strategy. I designed and developed this prototype as a way to test these methods with imersive content.

      heading: Implementation
      description: Given that this prototype was intended for as broad an audience as possible, I wanted it to be implemented a way that was both a compelling experience in a 2d browser /VR and VR device and controller agnostic (3DoF, 6DoF).  Despite it's early stage (limited functionality issues with browser support and network connectivity) I chose to develop the prototype in A-Frame.

      heading: Interaction Design 
      description: The interaction design for the prototype is intentionally simple, borrowing heavily from existing VR interaction design patterns.  Text is minimized for ease of experience, however tooltips will be added in future builds. Contextual content is accessed through content markers.

      heading: Menus
      description: The menus serve both a navigational and informational purpose, allowing a user to navigate between scenes and toggle the active model or 360. A similar nested menu UI pattern is used for both the model and 360 menus.

      heading: Markers
      description: Markers are embedded in the model view and indicate locations where content is available.  In the current build, only 360 content is supported. Future iterations will expand upon the marker component to display different types of content.

      heading: Controller input
      description: User input is simple and intended to provide a user with selection control and allow a user to navigate around a scene.  While 3DoF or 6DoF controllers are ideal, the prototype also works with WSAD/arrow controls on the keypad.  A reticle is present when not in VR view.

      heading: Environment Design 
      description: The design of the environments aims to capture the ephemeral qualities of light and shadow, dust moving across the landscape, flickering light, soft voices â€” some of the factors that helped the installation be perceived  as sacred space.
