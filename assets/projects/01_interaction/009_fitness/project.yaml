        Fitness trackers are one of the most ubiquitous wearables today. A myriad of apps exist that use and display fitness tracking data, yet there is still a very high rate of attrition with the use of these devices. Fit.ness aims to provide a solution to this problem. It is a simple iOS app targeting existing fitness tracker owners, which encourages users to maintain an exercise routine by meeting daily challenges.

        While our product concept was strong for the time, with compelling user interface and interaction design, this app like many others sadly did not get funded. It was however a great project to work on and a good experience in rapid concept development & presentation.
