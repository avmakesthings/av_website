description: I spent a little over two years working as a designer and project manager for Oakland based start-up, Hyphae Design Lab. Our work was focused bridging the gap between architectural/urban design and applied biological systems to help achieve more sustainable cities. The student works here explore the use of digital fabrication to create novel material tectonics and systems of construction.
