  My name is Anastasia Victor & I’m a User Experience & Interface designer with a background in architecture, digital fabrication & computational design. 
  I’m intereted in the intersection between design & technology and shaping the interfaces create this bridge.
  While I’ve worked as a designer & project manager for over 4 years, I’ve spent the past 2 years focused on consumer web and mobile products. 
  When I’m not nerding out about design I’m usually playing with modular synths, indulging my vinyl obsession, experimenting with GF cooking or snowboarding (if the season permits).
